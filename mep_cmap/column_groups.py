"""
mep_cmap.column_groups
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Which trial-level columns belong together, and which are never dropped.

``_trials.csv`` carries fifty-six columns. Most analyses use six of them. The
rest are not noise -- every one is there because some study needed it -- but a
table nobody can read across on one screen is a table whose columns get
selected in a spreadsheet by hand, which is where transcription errors come
from.

This module is to columns what ``results_layout`` is to folders: the single
place that says what goes where, so a metric added to the schema is assigned
deliberately rather than by whoever happens to touch the writer next.

NOTHING HERE NARROWS ``_trials.csv``. That file keeps every column, always.
Selection produces a SECOND file, ``_trials_selected.csv`` -- the TRIMMED
trials file, as the interface calls it -- beside it. The protected set below
is a complete join key -- File, Channel, StimType, Segment, Condition -- so
any column left out of the trimmed file can be recovered by merging it back
against the full one. That is what makes dropping a column safe: it is never
lost, only absent from one view.

LAT_COLS is not touched, read, or reordered by any of this. Narrowing happens
on a copy of the written frame, at write time.

#: irrecoverable and most columns need no partner. It is whether the missing
#: column carries information that VARIES BETWEEN ROWS and silently changes
#: what the retained number means.
#:
#: Only one column pair meets that. reference_map is per stimulus type, so a
#: recording whose TMS conditions normalise to CSE and whose M-wave normalises
#: to Mmax puts ratios against two different denominators in one
#: Normalised_Adjusted_PTP_QR column. With Reference_Type present the column is
#: heterogeneous and says so; without it the column is heterogeneous and looks
#: uniform. Stack several sessions into the group file and the mixing is across
#: participants too.

#: Everything else means the same thing on every row. Z_PTP_Within without
#: PTP(mV) is still a z-score; PTP_per_PreStimRMS without PreStimRMS is still

#: amplitude effectively impossible to deselect, which is the case the feature
