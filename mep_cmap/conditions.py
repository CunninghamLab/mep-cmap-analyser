~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Assigning a recording's stimulus events to named conditions.

Why this exists
---------------
A recording's own markers say what kind of stimulus fired, not what it was
for. Twenty pulses labelled ``A`` may be ten before an intervention and ten
after, or three intensities of a recruitment curve, and nothing in the file
distinguishes them. Only the analyst knows, and until now there was nowhere to
say so: the analysis grouped by stimulus type and a session's structure had to
be reconstructed afterwards from trial numbers, if it could be recovered at
all.

A condition is therefore a second axis alongside the stimulus type, not a
replacement for it. ``A`` determines how a response is detected -- its latency
window, its muscle, whether a silent period applies -- and those settings are
identical before and after an intervention. ``pre`` and ``post`` determine
nothing about detection and everything about what the trial means. Collapsing
the two into one name, which is what a single label field forces, loses that
distinction and leaves the analyst configuring the same latency window twice.

The output is a BIDS ``_events.tsv``: ``onset``, ``duration``, ``trial_type``
and a ``condition`` column. Not a private format, because the events file is
already read by this tool's own EDF path and by anything else that understands
BIDS, and a condition assignment is exactly the kind of thing that should
survive being read by something other than the program that wrote it.

Composition
-----------
The analysis groups by a single key, so a stimulus type and a condition are
composed into one -- ``A`` and ``pre`` become ``A·pre``. That happens HERE,
explicitly, and not in the reader: a file on disk states a trial type and a
condition in separate columns, and stays legible to a tool that has never
heard of this one. :func:`group_events` is the single place the two are joined,
so the analysis and the preview cannot compose them differently.

An event with no condition composes to its trial type alone, so a recording
whose conditions were never touched produces exactly the keys it always did.

This module holds no Tk and touches no file: it is the rules, so that they can
be tested without a display and without a recording.
