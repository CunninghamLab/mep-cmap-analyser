mep_cmap.conditions_tab
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Setup ▸ Conditions — assigning a recording's events to named conditions.

The rules live in :mod:`mep_cmap.conditions`, which holds no Tk and is tested
without a display. This module is the surface: a table, a trial selector, and a
pane for looking at what has been selected. Keeping the two apart is what allows
the parsing, splitting and completeness rules to be exercised properly, since
almost none of what can go wrong here is a drawing problem.

The workflow
------------
The table opens populated: one row per stimulus type the event sources found,
each holding all of that type's trials. That state produces exactly the analysis
the recording produced before conditions existed, so the tab is somewhere to go
when a file needs it rather than a step every file must pass through.

From there a row is selected, its trials appear in the list and its epochs in
the review pane, and the row can be split: select ten of twenty ``A`` trials,
name them, and the remaining ten stay behind. The point of doing it here rather
than by typing two trial lists is that a split cannot lose or duplicate a
trial, which two independent assignments can.

Why look at the epochs at all
-----------------------------
Because the question the tab answers is not one the file can answer. Deciding
that trials 1-10 were the baseline block is the analyst's knowledge, and the
only check available is whether the waveforms look like they belong together.
Hence overlay, average, or both: the overlay shows spread and outliers, the
average shows what the condition will contribute, and comparing two conditions
side by side is how a split is judged before it is applied.

No detection markers are drawn here, deliberately. This is raw epochs before
any analysis; onset and amplitude belong to Preview detection, where they are
shown one trial at a time because a dozen sets of markers on one axes cannot be
read.
