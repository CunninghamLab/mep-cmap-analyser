"""
mep_cmap.detection.defaults
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The single source of truth for detection parameter defaults.

Before this module the same default appeared in up to four places — the
``PipelineConfig`` dataclass, ``preferences.DEFAULTS``, the Tk variable
initialisers in ``app.py``, and the session-restore fallbacks in the same file
— and they were already out of step: ``PipelineConfig.onset_method`` defaulted
to ``peak_fraction`` while ``preferences`` defaulted to ``bigoni``. The GUI
masked it, because it always passes an explicit value, so the divergence only
surfaced for code driving ``PipelineConfig`` directly.

Every default is defined here once. Consumers read from these dicts rather than
restating literals, and ``tests/test_detection_defaults.py`` asserts that the
config, the preferences and this module agree on every shared key — so a future
change made in only one place fails the suite instead of shipping.

Keys are named for their ``PipelineConfig`` field. Three preference keys
predate that convention and cannot be renamed without invalidating every saved
``~/.mep_cmap/preferences.json``; ``PREF_KEY_ALIASES`` maps them.
