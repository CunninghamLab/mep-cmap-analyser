mep_cmap.io
~~~~~~~~~~~
Format-agnostic public API for reading EMG data files.

Supported formats (auto-detected from file header)
----------------------------------------------------
  Spike-2 text export  — header contains "SUMMARY" / "START" / "CHANNEL" blocks
  LabChart text export — header line 0 starts with "Interval="
  Generic TSV          — headerless / all-numeric tab/space/comma delimited text
                         (requires a one-time Format Wizard dialog on first open)
  Epoched MATLAB       — pre-cut TMS-EMG trials (Chans/Markers/Conds/Events)
                         (requires a one-time unit-confirmation dialog)

Adding a new format
-------------------
  1. Create mep_cmap/formats/<format>.py with the three public functions.
  2. Add detection logic to detect_format().
  3. Add a dispatch branch to each of the three public functions below.
  4. Nothing else in the codebase needs to change.

Public API
----------
  detect_format(file_path)                     -> 'spike2' | 'spike2_smr' | 'labchart' | 'cfwb' | 'generic_tsv'
  needs_wizard(file_path)                      -> bool
  list_waveform_channels(file_path)            -> list[str]
  list_event_channels(file_path)               -> list[str]
  extract_emg_waveform_and_fs(file_path, ch)   -> (np.ndarray, int, str|None)
  extract_stim_times(file_path, marker_name)   -> dict[str, list[float]]
  get_epoch_bounds(file_path)                  -> (pre_ms, post_ms) | None
  units_assumed(file_path)                     -> bool
  get_clipped_trials(file_path, channel_idx)   -> list[int]

Pre-epoched formats
-------------------
Most readers return a continuous recording.  A pre-epoched reader instead
returns its trials stitched into a pseudo-continuous trace separated by
guard-band padding, plus synthetic stim times.  Such a format reports a
non-None get_epoch_bounds(); callers must clamp their analysis windows to it
(see that function for why silence here is dangerous).

Generic TSV — wizard integration
---------------------------------
When detect_format() returns 'generic_tsv' and no sidecar config exists yet,
the caller (app.py / _browse_file_path) must launch FormatWizard before
calling list_waveform_channels() or extract_*.

The recommended pattern in app.py is:

    _fmt = detect_format(fpath)
    if _fmt == 'generic_tsv' and needs_wizard(fpath):
        _launch_format_wizard(fpath, on_complete=lambda cfg: ...)
        return   # _browse_file_path will be called again from the callback
    ...
    chan_list = list_waveform_channels(fpath)
