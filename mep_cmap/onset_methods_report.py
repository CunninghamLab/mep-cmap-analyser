mep_cmap.onset_methods_report
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Per-file comparison of the onset detectors, as tables and figures.

When onset-method agreement is enabled, every member method runs on every
trial. The pipeline keeps only the median, the spread and the count; the
individual latencies are discarded. This module retains them and turns them
into two tables and three figures, at no extra detection cost -- the detector
runs have already happened.

What this is for
----------------
The recurring practical question is not "which detector is best" -- no detector
wins across resting and active paradigms, SNRs and muscles -- but "which trials
do I need to look at, and does my choice of method matter for this dataset".
A number in a spreadsheet does not answer the second question; seeing where
each method lands on the actual waveform does.

What this is NOT
----------------
Agreement is not accuracy. Detectors that share an assumption can be wrong
together, and two of the members are not independent at all: the walkback
variant starts from the plain derivative method's answer, so their agreement is
partly structural. Tight agreement means the methods concur, not that they are
right. Establishing accuracy needs ground truth -- expert manual marking, or
simulation with a known onset. Every figure produced here carries that caveat
in its subtitle, because a reader who does not already know it is exactly the
reader who will over-read the plot.

Triggering
----------
These outputs follow ``cfg.onset_agreement``, NOT the selected onset method.
The two are independent: agreement runs the member detectors whatever method is
selected, and comparing methods while running the one you trust is the more
useful case -- that is how a method choice gets justified. Selecting
Selecting the median-across-methods detector without enabling agreement
produces no comparison outputs,
and
the pipeline says so rather than writing nothing silently.

  * collect_agreement_rows      -- long-format per trial x method table
  * build_method_summary        -- per stim type x method statistics
  * write_onset_method_tables   -- both CSVs
  * plot_onset_methods_on_trace -- where each method lands on the waveform
  * plot_method_agreement       -- latency by method, per condition
  * plot_bland_altman           -- each method vs the others' median
  * plot_disagreement_distribution
  * write_onset_method_figures  -- all of them, into a subfolder
  * figures_subdir              -- the subfolder this module writes into

Figure layout
-------------
Figures go into ``figures/<bids_prefix>_onset_methods_figures/`` rather than
directly into ``figures/``. This matches the convention the bundled add-ons
already use (``<bids_prefix>_<name>_figures``), and it matters here because a
file with eight stimulus types produces eleven images -- enough to bury the
trace figures the main pipeline writes alongside them.

    A Bland-Altman plot of a method against the median of all methods is a
    part-whole comparison: the method being assessed is one of the values that
    median is computed from, so it is correlated with its own reference. That pulls
    the bias toward zero and narrows the limits of agreement, making every
    method look better than it is -- and the fewer members there are, the
    worse the distortion. With five members a method contributes a fifth of
    its own comparator.

    Recomputing the median without the method under test removes that.
    Bland & Altman make the same point about comparing a method with a mean
    that includes it; leave-one-out is the standard remedy.

    single remaining value is not a median across methods.

    One panel per method. Horizontal axis is the mean of the two estimates,
    vertical axis their difference, with the bias and the 95% limits of
    agreement drawn across. Points are coloured by stimulus type, because a
    method can be unbiased overall while being systematically early on one
    condition and late on another -- a pooled bias of zero would hide exactly
    the pattern worth acting on.

    The reference is the LEAVE-ONE-OUT median by default: the method under
    test is excluded from the median it is compared against. Comparing a method
    with a composite that contains it is part-whole, which drags the bias
    toward zero and narrows the limits, flattering every method. Pass
    ``use_loo=False`` to reproduce the naive version for comparison.

    What the plot cannot show
    ------------------------
    Neither reference is truth. A method that agrees closely with the others is
    typical, not correct; if the members share a systematic error the bias will
    read as zero. Interpret the SPREAD (limits of agreement) as the practical
    consequence of a method choice, and treat the bias as a description of
    where a method sits relative to its peers, not as an error.
