mep_cmap.overlay
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Every chosen trial of a condition on one set of axes.

The preview shows one trial at a time, which answers "did the markers land
sensibly on this trial" and cannot answer "is this setting right for this
condition". The second question is about a DISTRIBUTION: whether onsets cluster
or scatter, whether the amplitude window contains the response on most trials
or only the large ones, whether one trial is unlike the rest. No single trial
shows any of that, and stepping through eighty of them turns a distribution
into a memory test.

So this draws them together, with the amplitude window the analysis will
actually use marked across them, and a strip of detected onsets beneath. The
single-trial view is not replaced: a trace can be clicked to open it, because
"which trial is that outlier" is the question an overlay always raises next.

Nothing here detects anything. Both the traces and the onsets come from what
the preview already computed, so the overlay cannot disagree with the preview
about what the detector did.

Approach adopted from the TMS Analysis ToolBox (Cunningham et al.), which
overlays a condition's trials for exactly this purpose. Written independently;
no code was taken.
