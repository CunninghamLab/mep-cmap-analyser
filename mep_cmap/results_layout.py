"""
mep_cmap.results_layout
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Where a result file goes inside ``results/``.

One recording writes nine files per channel. A two-channel study is eighteen
loose files in one folder; a five-channel study is forty-five, and every add-on
adds one more per channel. The folder stops being readable long before the
study stops being ordinary.

Grouped by OUTPUT FAMILY rather than by channel: an analyst comparing a
measurement across channels has them side by side, and the number of folders is
fixed by what the tool produces rather than growing with the recording.

FILENAMES DO NOT CHANGE. A file has to be identifiable from its name wherever
it ends up -- moved, copied into a manuscript folder, or attached to an email --
so the full BIDS prefix stays even though it is redundant inside a folder that
already implies part of it. It also means nothing that already reads these
files by name has to change.

Nothing is ever moved. Existing studies keep the flat layout they were written
with, and :func:`search_roots` reads both, so a folder half in each state still
loads completely.
