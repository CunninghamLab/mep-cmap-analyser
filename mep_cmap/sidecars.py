mep_cmap.sidecars
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Where a format reader keeps what it was told about a recording.

Three readers hold a small configuration per file: which channel Spike2 should
treat as EMG, how a generic TSV's columns map onto channels, what unit a
pre-epoched MATLAB file is in. Each wrote it beside the recording, as
``<stem>.smr_config.json`` and friends.

That put tool state into the raw data. In a BIDS study ``rawdata/`` is what the
acquisition system wrote, and everything derived from it belongs under
``derivatives/``: a folder that can be deleted and rebuilt, backed up
separately, or handed to a collaborator without carrying one program's
settings along. It also meant "reset from scratch" had to know three filename
rules to clean up after itself, and a read-only or archived rawdata tree could
not be configured at all.

Migration
---------
Changing where a file is looked for makes every existing one invisible, and a
tool that silently forgets what it was told is worse than one that never
remembered: the analyst is asked to configure files they configured last week,
with no explanation and no clue that an answer exists somewhere. So the old
location is still read, and the first time a sidecar is found there it is moved.

The move is best-effort. A rawdata tree mounted read-only is exactly the
situation this change is meant to help, and failing to tidy it up is not a
reason to refuse to read it.
