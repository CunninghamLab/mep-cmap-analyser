"""
Guard: every detection parameter must be reachable from the GUI and reach the
pipeline.

The Detection preferences tab used to list its methods and parameters as
literals. A detector could therefore be fully implemented, registered,
dispatched and tested, and still be unusable -- which is exactly what happened:
``rms_envelope``, ``cusum`` and ``consensus`` ran correctly everywhere except
that no radio button offered them, so the only way to select one was to hand-
edit ``preferences.json``.

The same shape of failure applies to parameters. A value can exist in
``detection.defaults``, have a preferences property, and still never reach
``PipelineConfig`` because the GUI snapshot did not copy it -- and nothing
errors, because the config falls back to the canonical default and produces a
perfectly plausible number.

These tests analyse the source statically rather than driving Tk, so they run
headless. They check wiring, not appearance: that the radio list is generated
from the registry, and that every canonical key is carried from preferences
into the params dict and out again into the config.
