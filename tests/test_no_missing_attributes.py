"""
Catch reads of attributes and methods that do not exist.

Python resolves ``self.foo`` at runtime, so a typo or an invented name is
invisible until that line executes -- and in a GUI, that can mean a handler
that only fires when someone clicks a particular control. pyflakes does not
look at attribute access, so nothing in the existing checks catches it.

This has now bitten three times in one working session, each time in a
callback:

  * ``self.stim_types_found``     -- invented; the real name is
                                    ``_current_stim_types``
  * ``self._harvest_labels_tab``  -- called before it was written
  * ``self._set_confirm_state``   -- likewise

Every one imported cleanly, passed the whole suite, and failed in front of the
analyst. The check below is crude -- it cannot see attributes created
dynamically -- but it reads the whole class in a second and would have caught
all three.
